# Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge
A random forest regression model to suggest the right product prices for Mercari (Japanâ€™s biggest community-powered shopping app).

The contributing model consists of the following process:
 - data preprocessing with numpy and pandas 
 - feature engineering
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud
 - random forest model
